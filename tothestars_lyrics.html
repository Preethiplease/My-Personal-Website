<p class="lyrics" align="center">
  You got me feeling crazy for you baby<br>
  Voices in my head call out your name<br>
  Killing in those ripped jeans and your nikes<br>
  No u don’t even try you just do it right<br>
  Meet me down the street when the city’s all sleeping<br>
  U know u got a taste for the cherry that u see<br><br>

  I know u want it<br><br>

  You and me, don’t think just screw the city<br>
  You fit me, fit me like my puzzle piece <br>
  You know me, know me like nobody else<br>
  You take me past the sky oh baby take me to the stars yeah!<br><br>

  I don’t care, if there’s somebody watchin’ us<br>
  I want your arms around me, holding tight<br>
  I can’t go missing all this crazy fun<br>
  Just take me past the sky oh baby take me to the stars ohh!<br><br>

  And, and it’s all really amazing<br>
  Like love is in the air (everywhere)<br>
  I could feel it.. With <br>
  The vibes, those eyes, his skin, his lips are Like.<br>
  Damn!!<br><br>

  And i got u feeling crazy for me baby<br>
  Tripping like you’re trapped in a movie scene <br>
  Spending every minute like u wanna be with Me<br>
  No you can’t even leave when u gotta leave<br>
  Meet me when the clock strikes 12 ,you told me<br>
  U know i have a thing for the way u see Me<br><br>

  You know i like it<br><br>

  You and me, don’t think just screw the city<br>
  You fit me, fit me like my puzzle piece <br>
  You know me , know me like nobody else<br>
  You take me past the sky oh baby take me to the stars yeah!<br><br>

  I don’t care, if there’s somebody watchin’ us<br>
  I want your arms around me, holding tight<br>
  I can’t go missing all this crazy fun<br>
  Just take me past the sky oh baby take me to the stars ohh!
