<p class="lyrics"  align="center">
I really wish you knew <br>
All my crimson-coloured blues<br>
So I’d sit there in my room<br>
Write my songs all about you <br><br>

And this is nothing new<br>
When my feelings get marooned<br>
I just whisper to the moon<br>
Wishing you would feel it too<br><br>

But when you flew away<br>
Did you ever think of me?<br>
Did you dream of me?<br>
Cause I dreamed about you every day<br>

I worshipped you <br>
For a long long time, you never knew<br>
When i look at that sky so perfect blue<br>
All i see is you<br><br>

i wanted you,<br>
I tried everything but i made a fool<br>
If you’re “Ocean deep” said i’d dive for you<br>
But you never knew<br><br>

And I would still do, anything for you<br>
But I don’t want somebody who never wanted me<br>
Set me free.
