                 <h2>Set Fire</h2>
                 <h3>Creation</h3>
                    <p align="justify">"Set Fire" like most of my songs was born during the solitude of quarantine. The song captures the essence of a soul that I imagined who, through love, discovers that the once-lonely world she inhabited becomes more bearable, more beautiful—simply because she found the one. <br><br>The inspiration for this piece came from a Telugu phrase, <span>"నచ్చకపోతే చెప్పు, తగలపెట్టేస్తా</span> / nachakapothe chepu thagalapetestha", which roughly translates to "I'll burn it down if you don't like it." This defiant sentiment sparked the creation of "Set Fire", one of my best songs ever written!</p>

                    <h2>Wish You Knew</h2>
                    <h3>Creation</h3>
                        <p align="justify">'Wish You Knew' is a song about one soul longing for another who has moved on and is fully embracing their life. When she found herself writing many songs about the same person, she realized it was time to move on. <br><br>She wrote this song as a form of closure, expressing her unreciprocated feelings for someone who moved on long ago, unaware of this soul still longing for him. Thus, the song ends with a plea: 'Set me free.'. I was highly influenced by Taylor Swift's song 'Maroon' during the writing of this song, so you might hear some of her influence.

                  <h3>Creation</h3>
                    <p align="justify">'I Love It' I absolutely love it! haha. This song is about how two souls in love experience something so unique and special that those around them can't quite grasp it. Even though love holds a universal frequency that everyone has felt at least once, it still manages to give you butterflies like it's the first time, and all you wanna do it just make this feeling last.<br><br> In this song, she decides to express all the things she loves about him and the little things he does that make her feel this way. She also assures him that if he ever misses her, they can rewind and relive the moments to bring it all back."

                      <h2>To The Stars</h2>
                      <h3>Creation</h3>
                        <p align="justify">By now, you might be thinking, 'Oh, it's all just love songs—stories of a girl chasing after or expressing her love for a guy.' And you're absolutely right! What else would a girl like me dream of during quarantine?<i> Also, I experimented with GarageBand and made a track for this song, I'm pretty proud of it, check the video out.</i><br><br>
                          So, 'To the Stars' was inspired by Ellie Goulding's 'Love Me Like You Do,' where she sings, 'Let me take you past our satellites.' I thought, 'Oh, I would love it if someone took me past the sky to the stars!' Based on that idea, here's a song about a girl crushing on a guy who's crushing on her too.

                      <h2>Feel It Different</h2>
                      <h3>Creation</h3>
                          <p align="justify">'Feel It Different'— Oh yes, it’s another song about chasing a boy. I also roughly recorded a GarageBand track when I first had an idea of how I wanted the production to sound. might attach it here later. The version I have right now is something only I can understand. ^^'<br><br> When a soul longing for someone finally gathered the courage to confess, the boy responded with a rather disappointing answer: 'I don't feel the same way, take care of yourself.' The girl, who was completely obsessing over him, had no idea how to cope, so she poured her feelings into this song during one of her sleepless nights. But don’t worry, the girl’s all grown up and doing well now!
