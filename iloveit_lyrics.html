<p class="lyrics" align="center">
  Every time you kiss me <br>
  My heart beats all the melodies<br>
  Baby don’t you miss me<br>
  We can rewind all the memories<br><br>

  When you let your slow hands<br>
  run through my hair and your<br>
  Starry eyes stare into my soul<br>
  (I love it baby)<br><br>

  When you whisper in my ears<br>
  “No matter what happens to us<br>
  You and I’ll be safe and sound”<br>
  (So safe and sound)<br><br>

  Can we lie under the moonlight?<br>
  Can we name those stars after us?<br>
  You gave my darkest days your daylight <br>
  So baby i just want you to kiss me<br><br>

  Cause every time you kiss me <br>
  My heart beats all the melodies<br>
  Baby don’t you miss me<br>
  We can rewind all the memories<br><br>

  When you lie to your friends <br>
  Saying that you’re super busy <br>
  Cause you wanna be here with me<br>
  (I love it baby)<br><br>

  Well they were laughing, they said<br>
  “Nothings permanent”<br>
  Baby they will never know this feeling<br>
  They’ll never know it<br><br>

  You know I understand the things you want me to<br>
  I wanna see you smile, you do it when your eyes
  meet<br>
  I think i found the one, you think that I’m the one<br>
  So baby i just want you to kiss me<br><br>

  Cause every time you kiss me <br>
  My heart beats all the melodies<br>
  Baby don’t you miss me<br>
  We can rewind all the memories<br><br>

  I love it when you love me like that<br>
  I love to see you love me like that<br>
  I love it when you love me like that<br>
  Oh baby I would love you like that!
