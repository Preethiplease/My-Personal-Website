  Silver lining.. shinin' so brightly<br>
  hope you'll realise that I could be the one<br>
  Every night.. dreamin' all about you<br>
  ( You ) gotta know that i still feel that you're the one<br><br>

  you played it really subtle<br>
  your smile, the way you style <br>
  Oh damn.. I can't explain this feeling but I feel it wild<br><br>

  You know i'm crazy for you<br>
  I’d do anything for you<br>
  I just don't get it why you.. can't see what i'm clearly seeing<br><br>

  (But)<br><br>

  I can not get you out of my.. head<br>
  "I feel it different" that's what you said, oho<br><br>

  Intertwined.. you and I under sheets<br>
  The words you whispered i still think about it all<br>
  Every night... I try to stay away from (you)<br>
  you struck me hard I end up thinking about it all<br>

  I loved every second of it<br>
  Yeah every second of it<br>
  Cause you were everything I wanted baby let me get it<br><br>

  You know i'm crazy for you<br>
  I’d do anything for you<br>
  I just don't  get it why you.. can't see what i'm clearly seeing<br><br>

  (Cause)<br><br>

  I can not get you out of my.. head<br>
  "I feel it different" that's what you said, oho
