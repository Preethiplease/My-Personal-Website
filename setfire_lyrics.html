<p class="lyrics" align="center">
  Fuel, flame<br>
  You and me<br>
  Come with me<br>
  We'll set the world on fire<br><br>

  My heart is racing <br>
  I feel it rushing<br>
  Nobody but you <br>
  set my world on fire<br><br>

  Aaaa.. with your body right here next me<br>
  Aaaa.. I’m sweating in the winter<br>
  Aaaa.. I’m flying instead falling<br>
  In love and I don't think I'm here I'm somewhere out there.. flying<br><br>

  Cause the thunders, lightning, everything that's frightening <br>
  They don't scare me anymore you took me up higher<br>
  The haters, fakers people playing pokers,<br>
  We don’t have to worry we can set them up on fire<br>
  Lala.. La la.. Lala.. La la<br>
  You and me, we’ll set the world on fire<br>
  Aaaa.... Aaaa... Oh! <br><br>

  Fun and games<br>
  If we're to blame<br>
  We'll go out and <br>
  set this place on fire<br><br>

  You be driving<br>
  I'll be singing<br>
  We’ll roam around<br>
  and set the roads on fire<br><br>

  Aaaa.. When your steering it and gearing up<br>
  Aaaa.. I'm staring cause you’re so hawt<br>
  Aaaa.. I’m flying instead falling<br>
  In love and I don't think I'm here I'm somewhere out there.. flying<br><br>

  Cause the thunders, lightning, everything that's frightening<br>
  They don't scare me anymore you took me up higher<br>
  The haters, fakers people playing pokers,<br>
  We don’t have to worry we can set them up on fire<br>
  Lala.. La la.. Lala.. La la<br>
  You and me, set the world on fire<br>
  Aaaa.... Aaaa... Oh!<br><br>

  Before you came along<br>
  I was freezing cause this place was stone cold<br>
  Aaa oh..<br>
  You set fire and you wrapped your arms<br>
  All around me just to keep me warm<br>
  Now you’re all I want.<br>
  Aaaa.. aaaa.<br>
